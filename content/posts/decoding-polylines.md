# Decoding Polylines: A Deep Dive into Geographic Coordinate Processing

## Introduction

Polyline encoding is a method used in geographic applications to compress latitude and longitude points into a compact string format. This is widely used by mapping services like Google Maps to encode route paths efficiently, saving bandwidth when transferring data. But how do you decode these polylines back into readable geographic coordinates?

In this article, we will walk through the process of decoding an encoded polyline string and converting it into an array of latitude and longitude coordinates. We'll focus on the practical application of this decoding algorithm using JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Understanding Polyline Encoding

The Google Encoded Polyline Algorithm encodes a list of latitude/longitude points as a single string by:

1. Converting geographic coordinates into a format that reduces the amount of data transmitted.
2. Encoding the differences between consecutive points rather than encoding each point directly.
3. Compressing the result by using variable-length encoding, which minimizes the size of the data.

## How Polyline Decoding Works?

When you receive an encoded polyline, it's essentially a long string that needs to be decoded back into geographic points. The algorithm for decoding this string works as follows:

1. Process each character in the encoded string by interpreting the value in chunks.
2. Convert the ASCII values into usable data by subtracting a base value (63).
3. Extract the actual latitude and longitude differences using bitwise operations.
4. Accumulate the lat/lng values incrementally from the previous point.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Weâ€™ll walk through each part of the code and explain how the decoding works.

```typescript
const points: [number, number][] = [];
let index = 0,
  lat = 0,
  lng = 0;
```

- _We start by creating an empty array points to hold the final lat/lng pairs. We also set index, lat, and lng to 0. These are used to keep track of the current position in the encoded string and the current latitude/longitude values._

```typescript
let b,
  shift = 0,
  result = 0;
do {
  b = encoded.charCodeAt(index++) - 63;
  result |= (b & 0x1f) << shift;
  shift += 5;
} while (b >= 0x20);
```

- _Decoding a chunk: The encoded string consists of several chunks representing latitudes and longitudes. We start by reading the characters, subtracting 63 to convert the ASCII character into its intended value._
- _Bitwise operations: The value is accumulated by extracting the lower 5 bits from the current character, shifting the result as needed._

```typescript
const dlat = result & 1 ? ~(result >> 1) : result >> 1;
lat += dlat;
```

- _Interpreting the delta: Once the value is fully decoded, we compute the delta for latitude. The algorithm checks if the result is negative or positive by checking the least significant bit._
- _Update latitude: We add the delta to the current latitude, building up the total value for each point._

```typescript
shift = 0;
result = 0;
do {
  b = encoded.charCodeAt(index++) - 63;
  result |= (b & 0x1f) << shift;
  shift += 5;
} while (b >= 0x20);

const dlng = result & 1 ? ~(result >> 1) : result >> 1;
lng += dlng;
```

- _Repeat the process for longitude: We use the same process to decode longitude. The same bitwise operations are applied to extract the encoded value, and then the delta is applied to the current longitude._

```typescript
points.push([lat / 1e5, lng / 1e5]);
```

- _Scale back the values: Since the latitudes and longitudes were multiplied by 1e5 (100,000) during encoding, we scale them back to their original values by dividing by 1e5._
- _Store the coordinates: The decoded point is pushed into the points array, and the process continues for the next point._

## Code Breakdown

```typescript
// The decodePolyline function decodes an encoded polyline into an array of latitude and longitude pairs.
const decodePolyline = useCallback((encoded: string): [number, number][] => {
  // Initialize an array to store the decoded lat/lng points
  const points: [number, number][] = [];
  // Initialize variables to keep track of the current index in the encoded string, latitude, and longitude
  let index = 0,
    lat = 0,
    lng = 0;

  // Loop through the encoded string
  while (index < encoded.length) {
    let b, // Temporary variable to hold the current character's value
      shift = 0, // Tracks how much to shift the current result
      result = 0; // Accumulates the decoded value for latitude or longitude

    // Decode latitude: read characters until a value less than 0x20 (32) is found
    do {
      b = encoded.charCodeAt(index++) - 63; // Subtract 63 to convert ASCII value to encoded value
      result |= (b & 0x1f) << shift; // Extract the lower 5 bits and shift to accumulate
      shift += 5; // Shift by 5 bits for each character read
    } while (b >= 0x20); // Continue until we reach the last character for this part of the encoding

    // Compute the change in latitude
    const dlat = result & 1 ? ~(result >> 1) : result >> 1; // If the result is odd, it's negative
    lat += dlat; // Update the current latitude

    // Reset variables to decode longitude
    shift = 0;
    result = 0;

    // Decode longitude: similar to how we decoded latitude
    do {
      b = encoded.charCodeAt(index++) - 63;
      result |= (b & 0x1f) << shift;
      shift += 5;
    } while (b >= 0x20);

    // Compute the change in longitude
    const dlng = result & 1 ? ~(result >> 1) : result >> 1; // Handle negative deltas similarly
    lng += dlng; // Update the current longitude

    // Add the decoded latitude and longitude to the points array, scaling them to their original values
    points.push([lat / 1e5, lng / 1e5]); // Coordinates are scaled by 1e5 (100,000)
  }

  // Return the decoded points as an array of lat/lng pairs
  return points;
}, []);
```

## Practical Applications

The `decodePolyline` function is essential in various mapping and location-based applications:

1. **Route Visualization**: Quickly render paths on maps for navigation apps.
2. **Geographic Analysis**: Process and analyze large sets of geographic data efficiently.
3. **Location Tracking**: Decode and display tracked paths or trajectories.
4. **Boundary Definitions**: Represent complex geographical boundaries or regions.

## Conclusion

Polyline encoding is a powerful way to reduce the size of geographic data for transmission over the web. By understanding how to decode polylines, you can take advantage of this compression and efficiently visualize routes on a map. The JavaScript function provided here demonstrates how to decode an encoded polyline into an array of lat/lng coordinates that you can then use in your web mapping applications.

By applying this technique, you can optimize your application to handle large sets of geographic data more effectively while still maintaining the integrity of the route visualization.
